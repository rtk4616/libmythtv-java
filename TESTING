Running Tests
================

There is a fairly comprehensive set of integration tests available in 
this repository. However, a lot of the functionality provided here can 
cause side affects (such as interfering with backend functionality, 
creating/deleting files, and changing settings). Any test for 
functionality which has side-effects that are not easily mitigated 
(such as deleting a file after transferring it to local disk) is 
commented out by default.



Test Settings
================

The test cases provided here use a properties file that is, by default,
located at ${user.home}/.libmythtv-java/settings.properties for each 
individual module. This location can be overridden by setting the 
environment variable LIBMYTHTV_JAVA_TEST_SETTINGS or passing the system 
property libmythtv.java.test.settings to the JVM (via -D). If this file 
is missing or does not have all possible settings defined, default 
values will come from the test module in the enum located at
test/src/main/java/org/syphr/mythtv/test/Settings.java.



Logging
================

libmythtv-java uses SLF4J to handle logging. For testing, JDK logging
is defined. Some custom logging settings are loaded by default by the
Settings enum used in the test cases. To override these settings, use 
the JVM argument -Djava.util.logging.config.file=/path/to/properties. 
The default config is located in the test module at 
test/src/main/resources/org/syphr/mythtv/test/logging.properties.
