Running Tests
================

There is a fairly comprehensive set of unit tests available in this
repository. However, a lot of the functionality provided here can cause
side affects (such as interfering with backend functionality, creating/
deleting files, and changing settings). Any unit test for functionality
which has side-effects that are not easily mitigated (such as deleting
a file after transferring it to local disk) is commented out by default.



Test Settings
================

The test cases provided here use a common properties file located at
src/test/resources/settings.properties. If this file is missing or does
not have all possible settings defined, default values will come from
src/test/java/org/syphr/mythtv/test/Settings.java.



Logging
================

libmythtv-java uses SLFJ to handle logging. For testing, JDK logging
is defined. To override settings, use the JVM argument 
-Djava.util.logging.config.file=/path/to/properties. A default config
is provided at src/test/resources/logging.properties.
