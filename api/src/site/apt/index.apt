MythTV High-Level API

  This module provides an abstracted API to the MythTV ecosystem as
  a whole. This is in contrast to the other APIs provided in sister
  projects that represent low level access to individual components
  of MythTV.

  Warning: this module is still in early development so this release 
  should be considered a code preview rather than a useable product. 
  The implementation as well as the public API are subject to change.
