MythTV Data Objects and Types

  This module provides common data holders and types for
  use across the libmythtv-java set of libraries. It is 
  not meant to be a standalone product, but  rather a 
  dependency of other MythTV libraries to keep consistency 
  throughout the modules and make the higher level 
  abstractions possible.
